        <p>File Wrangler teaches the basics of files and directories in the Linux command line.<br>You will use basic navigation commands to view files and directories and to move around between  directories. You will also use commands to create new files and directories and commands for     renaming, copying, moving and deleting them. Finally, you will use commands to view and change   file permissions.</p>
      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Background" duration="1">
        <p>Moving between directories and manipulating files and directories are essential foundations for  intermediate and advanced security exercises. This exercise will also introduce you to key       commands for managing file and directory-level access control in Linux. The man pages for given  commands can help when you are unsure of how to solve a challenge.</p>

        <p>The pwd command will give you the current working directory. This tells you where you are in the Linux file system.</p>

        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Type pwd into the prompt.</li>
          <li>Answer question 1 in EDURange.</li>
          <!--li> Go to the next task by typing the following into the prompt: cat task2</li-->

        <p>The man command outputs the manual entry for a given command. The format is as follows:</p>
        <code>man <command></code>

        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>View the manual entry for the pwd command by replacing <command> with pwd. (Note that you need to type q to get out of the manual!)</li>

        <p>Now that we know where we are, we will want to know what is in this directory. For a simple list of files and directories, you would use the list command.</p>

        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Type ls into the prompt for a list of files and directories.</li>

        <p>Steps</p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>View the manual entry for the ls command. Notice in the SYNOPSIS, the format of the command is as follows:</p>
            <code>ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...</code>
            <p>Anything in square brackets is optional. In this case, we can use ls along with one of the options listed with - or -- and we could add a complete file path.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Scroll through to manual to find the option that will provide a long listing format for the ls command.</li>
          <li>Answer question 4 in EDURange</li>
          <li>Try this command with the option you found. Donâ€™t forget to include the - or --! You can immediately tell whether the item is a file or a directory by the very first character provided in the output. Files are denoted by a - and directories are denoted by a d.</li>
          <li>Answer question 5 in EDURange</li>

        <p>Hidden files begin with a '.' and are not displayed unless you specify an option with the ls command.</p>

        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>View the manual entry for the ls command again.</li>
          <li>Scroll through to manual to find the option that will not ignore files that start with a '.'.</li>
          <li>Answer question 7 in EDURange</li>
          <li>Try this command with the option you found. You should see any hidden files or folders (those beginning with a '.').</li>

        <p>You can chain options for a single command. So, for example, you could include both the options for long listing and listing hidden files by simply adding each option after the ls command.</p>

        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Type this chained command now. You should now see all files and folders, including those that are hidden, and all of the details about them.</li>
